  <h1>User Test Results</h1>
  
<h3>Organization of Pages+Overlays</h3>

<p>My users mentioned that the organization of the first page seems to be crowded and that the title and the text box overlap. They said I could play around more with the positioning for the introductory page. The main page could be centered because on their screen it seems as if the cards and title are slightly more to the left side. The overlays seem to have a lot of extra space on their screen. I could see the scroll bar awkwardly in the right-middle side. I should make the overlay the entire page or make the overlay a different color from the background. I could move the text a bit more downwards on the page to get rid of the awkward space below.

  <h3>Interactions</h3>

<p>My user mentioned that I could add varying hi messages for all six cards when the user hovers over them. I asked about the overlay and which option would be the best. The first option which is the current option is the previous and next buttons which would be clicked to see extra photos. The next option would be an automatic timer slideshow and the last option would be scrolling. All of my users said that the scrolling idea would not be a good idea because the user may not know to scroll down. One of my users mentioned that the timer option could be helpful since the user may not have the attention to click on the previous and next buttons. However, all my users agreed on the current option as the best option and that I could make the buttons consistent on each overlay and more eye-catching so that the user will be encouraged to click on them. </p>
<h3>Positive feedback on Color+Images+Sounds</h3>

<p>I received positive feedback on the color scheme and images from all my users. They mentioned how the background gradient is a really cool effect. They mentioned that the blend of blue, pink, and purple of the background match well with the pastel colors of the mystery cat cards. They thought the illustration of the cat on each of the mystery cat cards was nice and they liked the photos I showcased for each cat behind the mystery card. The buttons of the close, previous, and next have a nice pop of color that match well with the whole theme of the page. The users also said that the varied sounds for when clicking on each cat was funny and an interesting way to add more interaction to my page.
