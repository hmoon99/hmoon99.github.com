      <h2>Game Design UX Best Practices</h2>
      <h3>May 18, 2021</h3>
      <p>After reading this article <a href="https://uxplanet.org/game-design-ux-best-practices-guide-4a3078c32099">UX Planet</a>, it reminded me of how important human-centered design is and how the designer must put themselves in the user’s perspective. When I am playing an online game app, I have never stopped to think about all these little details. After reading about the specifics, it has really been eye-opening. I thought it was so interesting that UI designers create the monetization aspects like the store button and more apps in the comfort zone which is where the user would most easily press. The sliders for extra content is such a common thing I see in games, and I think it is such an effective way to add extra content without navigating away from the main screen. Rewarded ad videos are also such a great idea for games. I have been a user who would watch the ads for extra coins and prizes. Something new I learned was about the dragging objects in games and the importance of the anchor point location to make it easier to drag and more user-friendly.

      <h2>Every Picture</h2>
      <h3>May 5, 2021</h3>
      <h2 id="part">Part 1</h2>
      <figure>
        <img src="cat.jpeg" alt="cat" style="width:100%">
        <figcaption>Hannah Moon 2020</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>This is a photo I took of a cat that lives in my neighborhood. I specifically like this photo because of the high quality. You can see the little details of the cat’s fur and like its green-yellow eyes which stand out. This image relates to my topic of my cat photo collection. I took my first photography class(DES113) last quarter and I did not have many people to photograph for the portrait assignment. However, I had a lot of subjects(cats) in my neighborhood that could pose for me. I was able to experiment and try to take pictures of these cats, hoping they wouldn’t run off. My collection is able to express my love for cats. I used to be quite scared of cats in the past, but have grown to like them after seeing them constantly in the neighborhood. I think due to this change in attitude towards cats, they are more important to me. Also, I found an interest in photography so it can showcase some of my favorite photos.

      <figure>
        <img src="bowl.jpg" alt="bowl" style="width:100%">
        <figcaption>Kajal 2020</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>This photo shows an upward view of a marble bowl with some interesting carvings of symbols or writing that I am personally not familiar with. It reminds me of ancient Egypt hieroglyphics carved into stone or wood due to the symbols carved in between two lines that serve as  a column. In this bowl, the symbols are carved in a circle in rows and the middle has a symbol that looks like a face. I think that the marble is very beautiful and the designs around the corners make the pottery piece unique and decorative. This image could  probably be an important collection of  Kajal’s pottery. It could also be something to do with Kajal’s culture. I wonder what  writing and symbols on the bowl mean and that would be a mysterious aspect of this image.

      <h2>Visual Thinking</h2>
      <h3>April 29, 2021</h3>
      <p>After scrolling through the website called <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/">Awwwards</a>, I came across <a href="https://tympanus.net/Development/PreviewContentTransition/">Preview to Content Transition</a>. It was a visually appealing and elegant looking website. The light forest green color of the page was easy on the eyes and matched the mood of the photos that the page displayed. The photography seemed professional and showed portraits of models with fancy and classy outfits. I particularly enjoyed the subtle interactivity of the page. The mouse is shown as a simple open circle that specifically interacts with the larger open circles next to the photos. When the user hovers over it,the movement that is activated has the titles disappear and slide which is interesting. The open circle theme fit perfectly with the visuals and was a clever way to make the interactivity a bit unique. The font choice really matched and contributed to the aesthetic feel of the page.</p>

      <h2>"Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows"</h2>
      <h3>April 22, 2021</h3>
      <p>Before coming across the article,<a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c
        ">“Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows”</a> by Naema Baskanderi,  I was very unfamiliar with the term “modal”.  After reading this article, I now understand what it is. It’s interesting to realize how commonly I have actually come across a modal window when browsing the internet, but did not know the term for the pop-up window itself.</p> <p>The most recent modal I have interacted with that I can remember was when visiting an online clothing store website where the moment you enter the site, it pops up. In this case, it definitely grabbed my attention. I remember seeing many of the elements mentioned in the article on the modal window I encountered. The background was darkened to bring more emphasis to the window. There was the x mark on the right upper corner. There was a button and it was centered on the screen in a reasonable size. It showed me a coupon of getting 15% if you sign up for a program. In this case, I was interested and signed up, but many times when visiting an article to read certain news, I automatically closed the modal because I did not ask for it and it appeared abruptly. </p><p>I definitely think the manner in which the modal window pops up affects whether or not the user will read what it says.</p>

      <h2>"Best Practices of Form Design" Response</h2>
      <h3>April 15, 2021</h3>
      <p>After reading the article, I recognized many of the practices that were shown and how it has made the process of filling out a form online much easier to fill out and complete.</p>
      <p>I definitely think that being straightforward and putting the most relevant information is important in a website or a mobile application. The design of the form that is presented determines whether a person will be willing to take interest and finish the questions. I agree that putting the easier, more simpler questions in the beginning would give the user more incentive to finish till the end even if the questions become more complex since they have already started or completed most of the form.</p>
      <p>Also, I have seen both examples of the placeholder text that the article shows, and I definitely agree that the second option is much better. I appreciate when the e.g. doesn’t go away while typing because sometimes I forget what I am typing while typing. I thought it was interesting how the article did not recommend the red asterisk mark for the mandatory options. I have seen this in many of the online forms I had to complete and I was fine with it.</p> <p>Another practice of the form feedback is such a key part in the process for me personally. I always like to get some sort of message that confirms that I successfully completed the form. It gives me a sense of accomplishment and ease.
      </p>
      <p>An example of a website that demonstrates good practices is Pinterest becuase it is easy to maneuver and straightforward.</p>
