      <h2>"Best Practices of Form Design" Response</h2>
      <h3>April 15, 2021</h3>
      <p>After reading the article, I recognized many of the practices that were shown and how it has made the process of filling out a form online much easier to fill out and complete.</p>
      <p>I definitely think that being straightforward and putting the most relevant information is important in a website or a mobile application. The design of the form that is presented determines whether a person will be willing to take interest and finish the questions. I agree that putting the easier, more simpler questions in the beginning would give the user more incentive to finish till the end even if the questions become more complex since they have already started or completed most of the form.</p>
      <p>Also, I have seen both examples of the placeholder text that the article shows, and I definitely agree that the second option is much better. I appreciate when the e.g. doesnâ€™t go away while typing because sometimes I forget what I am typing while typing. I thought it was interesting how the article did not recommend the red asterisk mark for the mandatory options. I have seen this in many of the online forms I had to complete and I was fine with it.</p> <p>Another practice of the form feedback is such a key part in the process for me personally. I always like to get some sort of message that confirms that I successfully completed the form. It gives me a sense of accomplishment and ease.

      <p>An example of a website that demonstrates good practices is Pinterest becuase it is easy to maneuver and straightforward.</p>
